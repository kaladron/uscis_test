# Welcome to the US Citizenship Test

All other Citizenship test apps I'd encountered had one or more of these problems.

1. Ads
1. Flashcards only
1. Inaccuracies

This app is designed to help you learn effectively and quickly.  There are three modes:

1. The View mode.

This mode just lets you look at questions, star the ones you want to find quickly.  It shows the official questions and answers, nothing more.

2. The Learn mode.

This mode drills you in the questions.  Responses must be spoken - just like you'd give them in the actual text.  You have a working set of questions and need to test out of them by getting them right three times in a row.  Make a mistake, and the counter starts again for that question.  The questions are chosen randomly and appear randomly so that you don't get used to a particular sequence.

3. The Test mode.

This mode simulates the oral exam.  The questions are spoken to you, and the answers have to be spoken back.  For the 2008 mode, 10 questions are chosen and you have to get 6 right.  In the 2020 mode, 20 questions are chosen and you have to get 12 right.  This simulates the test environment you'll be in so that you get used to it.

The spoken answers throughout look for accuracy - only mild deviations from the exact written answer are allowed.  This helps ensure that the answers given in the exam are close enough to what the examiner is looking for.
