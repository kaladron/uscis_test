# Privacy Policy

This US Citizenship Exam app does not collect any user data outside of standard metrics collected by the Google Play Store.

Two permissions are requested:
 * RECORD_AUDIO - required because the app uses voice recognition
 * INTERNET - required because some devices use cloud voice recognition and speech generation instead of on-device.
 
 Audio and usage is never sent back to me.  Terms of use of your device's speech recognition and generation also apply.
